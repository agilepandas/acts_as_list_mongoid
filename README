This is a port of the classic +acts_as_list+ to Mongoid.

ActsAsList
==========

This acts_as extension provides the capabilities for sorting and reordering a number of objects in a list. 
If you do not specify custom position +column+ in the options, a key named +pos+ will be used automatically.

See the specs for examples of how to use it.
